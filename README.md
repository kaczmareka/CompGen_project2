# Computational Genomics - Project 2
Authors: Agata Kaczmarek, Władysław Olejnik, Mateusz Stączek

The aim of this project is to identify the topologically associating domains (TADs) on the basis of the heatmap from Hi-C experiment.

## Data
The data we chose for this project is available in `\data` directory. The source of the data are as following: ADD SOURCES.

## Chosen approach
To solve the problem we used graph representation of interactions.

## Evaluation
As a ground truth for our algorithm we chose the results from the Arrowhead method. The evaluation of our solution with the description and interpretation of the results is in file `metrics_evaluation.ipynb`.

## Results

TO ADD SOME PLOTS

## Structure of the repository:
- `\data` - directory with the raw data we used,
- '\results` - direstory with all results we got from the processing, both with graph and later with evaluation metrics,
- `` - FILE WITH GRAPH IMPLEMENTATION - TO ADD,
- `metrics_evaluation.ipynb` - file with metrics evaluation and the results.
